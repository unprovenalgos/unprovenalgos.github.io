I bet you're wondering how we came up with this amazing, creative, beautiful name. Well, the credit actually goes to [Wilder]{https://www.wilderphilly.com/}. Given the fact that most of deep learning still remains unproven, we thought it suited the blog well. As an added bonus, the namesake drink tastes great too!
